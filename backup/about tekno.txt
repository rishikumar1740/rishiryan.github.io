Teknodeon is a 3 day national level college festival organized biannually by Kavikulguru Institute Of Technology And Science, Ramtek. Since the inception of Teknodeon it has managed to set new benchmarks every time. The age old adage of “experience has its own charm” holds water for Teknodeon as well because even though being conducted in the premises far from the reaches of Nagpur city, Teknodeon has managed to attract participants from length and breadth of the country. Teknodeon always revolved around a central theme which not only acted as glue for this vast event but also gave it’s action a meaning. Teknodeon 2k19 has found its inspiration from the rise of India’s domination in aerospace. Teknodeon also acknowledges the humble contribution of the affable missile man of India Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam.
